Most important tasks -- configurable by SBT project but usually unchanged

This is a list of tasks defined for the current project.
It does not list the scopes the tasks are defined in; use the 'inspect' command for that.
Tasks produce values.  Use the 'show' command to run the task and print the resulting value.

  clean            Deletes files produced by the build, such as generated sources, compiled classes, and task caches.
  compile          Compiles sources.
  console          Starts the Scala interpreter with the project classes on the classpath.
  consoleProject   Starts the Scala interpreter with the sbt and the build definition on the classpath and useful imports.
  consoleQuick     Starts the Scala interpreter with the project dependencies on the classpath.
  run              Runs a main class, passing along arguments provided on the command line.
  runMain          Runs the main class selected by the first argument, passing the remaining arguments to the main method.
  test             Executes all tests.
