# Functional Scala for Data Engineers

A fast-paced introduction to Scala's FP ecosystem for data engineers. 

These slides loosely follow Chiusano and Bjarnason's [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) with an emphasis on introducing Cats and various other FP libraries. Please read chapters 1-3 before beginning.

Welsh and Gurnell's [Advanced Scala with Cats](http://underscore.io/books/advanced-scala/) is an optional supplementary text, and their [Essential Scala](http://underscore.io/books/essential-scala/) is a minimal prerequisite for the course. The first two courses in Coursera's [Functional Programming in Scala Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala) are also highly recommended. 

Slides are viewable [here](http://DS12.github.io/scala-class).

A link to ScalaDoc will be available in the slide table of contents, above.
